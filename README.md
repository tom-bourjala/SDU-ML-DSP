# Diseases Prediction Using Machine Learning Algorithms

## Abstract

The advancement of artificial intelligence and machine learning has opened up new possibilities in various industries, including healthcare. Misdiagnosis errors in healthcare can have serious consequences, from delayed care to mistreatment and even death. Therefore, it is crucial to develop reliable tools that can assist healthcare professionals in making accurate and timely diagnoses.

This project focuses on the efficiency of different machine learning algorithms in predicting diseases based on symptoms. The performance of Logistic regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision tree, Random forest, and Neural network algorithms is analyzed using a dataset containing 4921 patients' records. Additionally, the study explores the use of probabilities with Neural network and Random forest algorithms to assess the confidence of the predictions and offer alternative diagnoses.

The dataset used in this project includes 133 distinct symptoms associated with 42 diseases. Data preprocessing methods, such as one-hot encoding and removal of duplicate data, are applied to optimize the dataset for machine learning.

The study concludes by comparing the performance of the various algorithms and identifying the most effective approach and techniques for predicting diseases based on symptoms. The potential of probability-based predictions in enhancing diagnostic accuracy is also discussed.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of various machine learning algorithms in predicting diseases based on symptoms. Logistic regression, KNN, Random forest, and Neural network models achieved high accuracy scores, highlighting their potential for accurate disease prediction. The Decision tree model had a slightly lower accuracy score but still showed promising results.

The use of probabilities in disease prediction models, particularly with the Random forest and Neural network algorithms, provides transparency and alternative diagnoses, enhancing the utility of the models in healthcare settings.

Further research could focus on addressing the issue of duplicate entries in the dataset to reduce overfitting and improve the reliability of the disease prediction models.
